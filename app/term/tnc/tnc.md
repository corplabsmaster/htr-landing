# Terms & Conditions

These terms were last updated: 25 August, 2025

These terms of use apply to the use of digital farming products, services, hardware, software, websites, digital resources and other market offerings (**Solutions**) made available by HiTerra and/or by any affiliates controlled by, or under common control with, HiTerra (in each case, HiTerra or **we** or **us**). Each organization or individual (**you**) wishing to make use of any of HiTerra’s Solutions is subject to these HiTerra Digital Farming Terms (**Terms**) together with any other Solution-specific terms that apply to the Solution offered and used.

**Important notices:**

These Terms apply to your use of all information, recommendations and/or Solutions provided to you by HiTerra. Certain Solutions have their own specific terms and/or additional agreements with HiTerra (**Solution-specific Terms**) that will apply to your use of that Solution. You should check and review any Solution-specific terms that might apply to the particular HiTerra Solutions that you choose to order and/or use. To the extent that the provisions of these Terms conflict with Solution-specific Terms, the Solution-specific Terms shall prevail. These Terms and any Solution-specific Term are together jointly referred to as the **Agreement**.

- Where you acquire elements of a Solution via a third party outside the HiTerra group, you may also be subject to that third party’s terms.
- Our separate HiTerra Privacy Policy also applies to you, and you should check that you understand and are aware of those privacy-related provisions.
- These Terms may be changed over time. You are advised to regularly read the terms that apply to the use of our Solutions for possible changes.

**By clicking or tapping any button or box marked "Accept", "Agree" or "OK" (or a similar term) referencing these terms, by signing up to a HiTerra Solution via a website, app or other digital channel, or by completing and sending to HiTerra an order form to which these terms are linked or attached, you agree to be bound by these terms, and you affirm that you are of legal age where you live and have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement as an individual or as an authorized representative of your company. You should print and keep a copy of these terms for future reference.**

### 1.0 HiTerra Solutions & Terms

1.1 HiTerra offers a number of Solutions to business users, which may include professional or other farmers and consultants for the purposes of improving farming methods and activity, and leveraging new and innovative digital technologies. For example, our Solutions may assist with farm management (work allocation, field tasks, inventory etc.), soil analysis, management of nutrient cycles, and related agronomic decision-making.

1.2 We provide Solutions in a number of different forms. Such forms may include:

(a) web-based or downloadable software (**Software**) and printed material or other documentation accompanying the Software (**Documentation**);

(b) mobile applications (**Apps**);

(c) remote-accessible or cloud-based or hosted services (**Services**);

(d) access to websites that are owned and/or branded by HiTerra and/or its affiliates (together, HiTerra **Websites**), and other digital content or resources such as email reports and portals;

(a), (b), (c) and (d) together, **Digital Content**; and

(e) hardware, including repair and maintenance services (**Hardware**).

1.3 In addition to these Terms, each Solution may be governed by Solution-specific Terms. To the extent that the provisions of any of the Solution-specific Terms conflicts with these Terms, the Solution-specific Terms shall prevail.

1.4 HiTerra offers and markets the Solutions to business users, which may include professional or other farmers and consultants. However, in jurisdictions where mandatory legislation dictates that professional or other farmers are to be considered consumers, such persons may be afforded certain augmented rights under applicable local law; and, in such cases, these Terms will not affect any applicable statutory consumer rights that cannot be waived under applicable law.

1.5 In the unlikely event that the provision or use of any Digital Content or Hardware pursuant to the Agreement contradicts any mandatory local law applicable to you, your right to access Digital Content or use Hardware may be terminated by HiTerra. In such circumstance, you agree not to use or access HiTerra Solutions, including any Digital Content or Hardware, in any way which might contravene applicable law.

1.6 There may be circumstances in which elements of a Solution are provided to you by a third party distributor or agent (**Non-HiTerra Supplier**) rather than direct from HiTerra. On such occasions, you must still agree to be bound by these Terms in relation to HiTerra and your use of a HiTerra Solution. You may also need to agree to additional terms, conditions and policies applicable to the relevant Non-HiTerra Supplier (such as hardware purchase terms, terms of service or privacy policies) (**Third Party Agreement**). It is your responsibility to verify and accept any applicable terms of any Third Party Agreement. The Non-HiTerra Supplier, and not HiTerra, is solely responsible for the performance of the Non-HiTerra Supplier’s obligations under any Third Party Agreement.

### 2.0 Accessing Digital Content

2.1 You are responsible for making all arrangements, and for providing appropriate resources and equipment, necessary to ensure that you have access to the Digital Content.

2.2 You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons employed or engaged by you who access the Digital Content through your Account are aware of these Terms and other applicable terms and conditions, and that they comply with them.

2.3 We may limit the availability of any Digital Content or any Solution to any person or geographic area at any time. If you choose to access Digital Content or Solutions from outside the geographic areas where HiTerra makes them available, you do so at your own risk and you may be in breach of these Terms or applicable law.

### 3.0 Information Submitted by You

3.1 Certain Solutions allow you to upload information to HiTerra App, HiTerra Website, or other HiTerra or third party portal, or to send soil or tissue samples or other information (**Samples**) to HiTerra for analysis. Such information includes, but is not limited to, text, photos of crops, agronomic information, Samples and other content (**User Content**). You are solely liable for the User Content that you provide.

3.2 You shall retain all intellectual property rights to any User Content that you upload.

3.3 HiTerra uses User Content to conduct its own agronomic and market research, and you grant to HiTerra the right to use, alter, publicly display, reproduce and distribute your User Content on any of HiTerra’s digital platforms, including third party marketing and distribution platforms. Your provision of such a right to HiTerra will always be subject to our HiTerra Privacy Policy, and we will always process your Personal Data in accordance with such HiTerra Privacy Policy.

3.4 You warrant that you are the owner of, or have the right to use, all uploaded User Content, and that you have the right to license such right to HiTerra in accordance with these Terms.

3.5 You represent and warrant that any information which you provide in connection with the Solutions is and will remain accurate and complete, and that you will maintain and update such information as needed or required under the circumstances.

3.6 Please also consult our HiTerra Privacy Policy for the privacy terms that may apply to your submission of information.

3.7 HiTerra is not responsible for any User Content. HiTerra will not actively monitor any User Content, but reserves the right to review User Content and delete such User Content at its own discretion and in accordance with applicable law.

### 4.0 Authority of Assent to Terms & Provision of Data

4.1 If you are an individual, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract. If you are procuring Solutions on behalf of your employer or a business entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of, and bind, your employer or the business entity and (if applicable) to subscribe to any Solution or agree to any applicable Solution-specific Terms. If you do not have such authority, you may not use the Solutions and we may immediately terminate your use of and access to the Solutions.

4.2 You represent and warrant that you are authorized to process the data that you provide to HiTerra, including Personal Data, and to make such data available to HiTerra for uses as set out in these Terms and our HiTerra Privacy Policy, including through: appropriate notice; consent; and by referring individuals, such as end users, to our privacy policies (notwithstanding HiTerra’s ability and right, to which you agree, to request consent and to provide notice and its privacy policies separately to such individuals).

4.3 For the purposes of these Terms, **Personal Data** means information that allows us to identify an individual.

### 5.0 Registration: Accounts, User Name & Passwords

5.1 Certain Solutions may require you to register a user account (**Account**) or otherwise enter a user name, password or other data, information or credential (**Access Credentials**) in order to make full use of a Solution. You agree to keep your Access Credentials and registration information accurate and up-to-date. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of these Terms and/or applicable Solution-specific Terms, which may result in the termination of your Accounts, and restrict your ability to access Digital Content and/or the Solutions.

5.2 You may obtain a number of different Access Credentials for the people within your business who are authorized to use a Solution for which you have validly registered or subscribed (**Authorized Users**). Where you do so, you must notify us of each individual within your business who is an Authorized User either (depending on the Solution) by registering such Authorized User with their own sub-Account or by requesting us to do the same on your behalf. Each Authorized User must have their own Access Credentials. Certain Solutions may also allow you to refer persons in your organization, and/or others authorized to access your Account (**Licensees**), using your Account Credentials. If you are an Authorized User or a Licensee, you must accept and comply with these Terms and any applicable Solution-specific Terms. If you register an Account, you agree that you are solely responsible for any and all activity on your Account and for ensuring that all Authorized Users and any Licensees comply with these Terms and any applicable Solution-specific Terms.

5.3 You may not register a user name that is illegal to use in any way, including names that can be mistaken for another person, legal entity or trademark or a name that is offensive in any way. HiTerra may reject your Access Credentials or other information that you provide to HiTerra.

5.4 Your Access Credentials are for your use only and should be kept confidential. You, and not HiTerra, are responsible for any use or misuse of your username or password, and you must promptly notify HiTerra of any confidential breach or unauthorized use of your Access Credentials.

5.5 Unless a minimum duration applies to you under these Terms or any Solution-specific Terms, you are free to close or stop using your Account at any time – although, if you do so, you will not be entitled to a refund of any Fees that you have pre-paid.

### 7.0 Fees & Payment Terms

7.1 Certain Solutions may require you to pay a fee to HiTerra (**Fee**) and/or to enter into a paid subscription and/or service agreement with HiTerra or one of HiTerra’s local affiliates, under which you will pay a subscription fee that will renew automatically with a frequency specified by HITerra in the Solution-specific Terms relating to the applicable Solution (**Subscription**). Solution-specific Terms may also set out any further services to be provided to you, including service descriptions, service levels, Maintenance Services and any warranty terms. The Fees (if any) that you are required to pay for a Solution, and other details about a Solution and its associated Solution-specific Terms, will be available within the online interface and other materials provided by HiTerra describing each Solution and any related services. In some cases, a Fee will be payable to access a Solution while, in other cases, Fees may only be payable either depending on your actual usage of the Solution or to upgrade to a premium version of the Solution. You agree to pay any applicable Fees associated with any Solution that you order and/or use at such payment frequency set out in the applicable Solution-specific Terms, and you are subject to these Terms with respect to your payments.

7.2 Any specific adjustments to the Solution, or further services that you require, may incur additional charges. Depending on the Solution, extended service levels may be agreed in writing between you and HiTerra if you have specific requirements for the Solution and the services that you require. Such written agreement will include details of your requirements and the scope of the service to be provided to you.

7.3 In relation to all Solutions and Solution-specific Terms, unless otherwise expressly stated by agreement with you:

(a) The term of the applicable Subscription will be for a period of 12 months from its date of commencement and, upon expiry, will automatically renew for additional 12 month periods until terminated by you or HiTerra.

(b) HiTerra may issue you with an invoice specifying the Fees payable by you and setting out the Solution, or versions of the Solution, that you wish to purchase. In other circumstances, you may be obliged to submit valid payment information prior to entering into Subscriptions under the Solution-specific Terms and receiving access to any applicable Solutions provided under such Solution-specific Terms. All Fees are due upon or prior to first use of a Solution or as otherwise specified in the applicable Solution-specific Terms. If you enter credit or debit card information, or similar means of payment, HiTerra will automatically charge the listed amount.

(c) Where applicable, you authorise HiTerra to collect payments by direct debit from the bank account that you provide to HiTerra, before you first use items in respect of which a Fee is payable. You shall also instruct your relevant bank to redeem the direct debits drawn by HiTerra into its account. You will not be entitled to claim a refund of the debited amount after the redemption has been implemented, but you may instruct your bank not to redeem direct debits until your payment of Fees to HiTerra becomes due.

(d) You or we can terminate any Subscription renewal to a Solution until the final day before the automatic renewal of such Subscription as set out in the applicable Solution-specific Terms. You must do so by submitting a notice to HiTerra in accordance with these Terms (**Termination Notice**), providing the following minimum information: Name, phone number, e-mail address and termination date. HiTerra will submit any Termination Notices to you via e-mail.

(e) Certain Solutions may offer you a free-trial period, or a demo or basic version of Digital Content, whereby you may use that Solution without paying a Fee for a specified time period, or for a limited number of users, or in respect of a limited range of functionality. Once your free-trial period comes to an end, you will no longer be entitled to use the Solution and may be required, at your expense, to delete any Digital Content and/or return any Hardware to HiTerra, unless you complete the necessary formalities which may include entering into Subscriptions under applicable Solution-specific Terms and/or paying the applicable Fees. Where HiTerra provides you with a demo version of Digital Content, you will need to pay the applicable Fees in order to gain access to the full range of Digital Content provided as part of the Solution.

(f) Except as expressly set out in these Terms, you will not receive any kind of refund upon termination of a Subscription.

7.4 You are responsible for paying any duties, customs fees, or taxes (other than HiTerra’s income tax) including indirect taxes such as “goods and services tax” associated with the purchase of each Solution, and any related penalties or interest (**Taxes**), and will pay the Fees to HiTerra without any deduction for Taxes. You acknowledge that in some jurisdictions, VAT or sales tax is due on the total purchase price at the time of sale and must be collected by HiTerra at the time of the sale. Except where expressly stated otherwise, Fees quoted for the supply of the Solutions are stated exclusive of VAT or sales tax, for which you shall be additionally liable at the applicable rate from time to time.

7.5 All payments are due in the currency stated in the applicable Solution-specific Terms. Any invoice or payment disputes must be submitted before the payment due date.

7.6 We may charge interest at the lower of (i) two (2%) percent per month or (ii) the maximum rate permitted pursuant to applicable law (if any) on any overdue payments from time to time, from the payment due date until paid in full, whether before or after judgment. You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including legal fees) incurred by HiTerra in collecting such overdue amounts, except where such overdue amounts are due to HiTerra’s billing inaccuracies. If you are overdue on payments for any of the Solutions, HiTerra may suspend or terminate all of the Services.

7.7 You shall pay all amounts due to HiTerra in full without any deduction or withholding except as required by law and you shall not be entitled to assert any credit, set-off or counterclaim against HiTerra in order to justify withholding payment of any such amount in whole or in part. HiTerra may at any time, without limiting any other rights or remedies it may have, set-off any amount owing to it by you against any amount payable by HiTerra to you.

### 8.0 Variation

8.1 To the extent permitted under applicable law, HiTerra may, at any time and in its sole discretion, modify these Terms, any applicable Solution-specific Terms, its HiTerra Privacy Policy, Subscription terms, and the specification, functionality and content of the Solutions (including but not limited to changes which are necessary to comply with any applicable safety or other statutory requirements or which do not materially affect the nature or quality of a Solution). Where any changes are material or substantive, HiTerra will provide you with reasonable advance notice of such changes, which may be by e-mail or posting through a relevant Solution-specific webpage or portal. HiTerra advises you to check regularly for changes.

8.2 If HiTerra makes any modifications, you will either comply with such changes or communicate to HiTerra your non-acceptance, in which case that communication will have the effect of a Termination Notice and you shall immediately cease using the applicable Solution. Your continued use of the Solution (including any use of the Solution after a notice of non-acceptance from you) shall be deemed to be acceptance of any such changes. You agree that HiTerra shall not be liable to you or to any third party as a result of taking these actions.

8.3 Concerning any Subscriptions that you have entered into with HiTerra:

(a) You may terminate a Subscription following a Significant Price Change only, and you shall be entitled to a pro rata refund of Fees equal to any advance payment(s) that you have made to HiTerra under the Subscription and which relate to services or use of a Solution that would have occurred in any period of time after termination. You are not entitled to refunds retroactively or for services provided or use of any Solution prior to termination.

(b) For the purposes of this Section, a Significant Price Change means an increase in the aggregate price payable by you for the Solution during the term of the applicable Subscription of greater than 30%.

### 13.0 Hardware

13.1 This Section 13 applies where, as part of a Solution, HiTerra provides you with Hardware subject to the following exceptions:

(a) You may acquire from HiTerra Martketplace that has been manufactured by third parties (**Third Party Branded Hardware**). Unless otherwise expressly stated in the applicable Solution-specific Terms, HiTerra shall not be liable for any defects in, or inoperability of, Third Party Branded Hardware, and you must rely upon any separate warranties provided by the relevant third party manufacturer or supplier in respect of any alleged defect of such Third Party Branded Hardware.

(b) You may acquire Hardware from a Non-HiTerra Supplier rather than HiTerra. If so, unless otherwise expressly stated in the applicable Solution-specific Terms, HiTerra shall not be liable for any defects in, or inoperability of, such Hardware, and you must rely upon the terms of your Third Party Agreement in respect of any alleged defect of such Hardware.

13.2 Except where our agreement with you specifies otherwise (for example where we rent or lease Hardware to you), title to the Hardware will pass upon full payment except that, in the case of Hardware in respect of which pre-payment has been made, title to the Hardware will pass upon delivery. Risk of loss to, and responsibility for, the Hardware pass to you upon delivery. Until title has passed from HiTerra to you (and in all cases where we rent or lease Hardware to you), you must insure, maintain and store the Hardware in satisfactory conditions, and you will return the Hardware to us at our request.

13.3 You shall maintain and operate the Hardware in accordance with the instructions provided by HiTerra and shall only allow the Hardware to be operated by competent and authorized personnel. HiTerra is not liable for any maintenance or modification of Hardware not undertaken by, or in accordance with instructions from, HiTerra or its authorized representatives.

13.4 All delivery timings that HiTerra may provide to you in relation to Hardware are estimates and not commitments. However, if the delivery of Hardware is delayed by more than 90 days from the stated date of delivery notified to you by HiTerra, and this is not due to your actions or inactions, you will have a right to: (1) withhold payment (unless full payment has already been made) due in respect of delayed Hardware, or (2) terminate the Agreement under which you ordered the delayed Hardware, entitling you to a refund of any Fees you have paid in relation to such Hardware.

13.5 You are responsible for:

(a) ensuring strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in relation to the import, transportation, storage and use of Hardware in the country and place to which Hardware is delivered;

(b) obtaining and maintaining in full force and effect, at your own cost, any licenses, authorizations, approvals, permits and other consents in relation to the import, transportation, storage and use of the Hardware as required from time to time; and

(c) if required by HiTerra, making copies of such licenses and consents available to HiTerra prior to delivery of the Hardware.

13.6 Hardware is delivered to you strictly on the condition that you have satisfied yourself of its suitability for your needs. Certain Hardware provided by HiTerra must be installed by HiTerra employee or representative (**Installation**). After Installation, the HiTerra employee or representative will perform an operational test of the Hardware in the presence of you or your representative. During the test, you or your representative must confirm that the Hardware is working correctly and check for malfunctions or defects (**Defects**). Any advice provided by HiTerra (or HiTerra employee or representative, as applicable) is given to the best of its knowledge, and will not relieve you from undertaking your own investigations and tests.

13.7 Where Hardware is delivered to you and/or installed, and you determine that there is a Defect with the Hardware, you must report the Defect to us within the earlier of (i) one month from the date on which you detected the Defect (or reasonably should have detected the Defect) or (ii) three months from the date of delivery to you of the Hardware (or, if later, the date of Installation by or on behalf of HiTerra) (the **Reporting Period**) unless a longer reporting period is expressly required by applicable law. Your report must include sufficient information to allow us to identify and verify the Defect, including but not limited to: a detailed description of the Defect and Hardware (including any documentation or information showing that the Defect was present at the time of the delivery), and any applicable invoice and order numbers.

13.8 If, after examining the Hardware, HiTerra determines that there is a Defect, and you have reported it to us within the applicable Reporting Period, HiTerra will remedy the Defect or replace the Hardware within a reasonable time, and will reimburse you for any shipping costs already paid by you to HiTerra or incurred by you, provided that such Defect does not arise from any misuse, wilful misconduct or any other fault on your part. If you have not paid fully for the Hardware, you will be entitled to withhold payment until HiTerra has remedied the Defect or replaced the Hardware. If, after examining the Hardware, HiTerra determines that there is no Defect, or if the Hardware shows clear signs that the Defect was caused by you or another third party, you shall be liable for any shipping, handling and related expenses, and any call-out or attendance costs incurred by HiTerra.

13.9 You may also be able to obtain maintenance services out-of-warranty as set out in any Solution-specific Terms (**Maintenance Services**). Where HiTerra agrees to perform such Maintenance Services, we shall do so at your expense. Fees payable for such Maintenance Services shall include, but not be limited to, HiTerra’s reasonable expenses and travel costs, if HiTerra provides the Maintenance Service at your premises.

13.10 If HiTerra provides remedial services in respect of any Defect or any Maintenance Services on your premises, you shall be obliged to provide suitable working conditions in accordance with applicable labor law and health & safety requirements.

13.11 HiTerra will not be liable to you if Hardware differs from its specifications as a result of changes made to ensure that the Hardware complies with applicable statutory or local requirements. In addition, HiTerra will not be liable for any Defects or inoperability of Hardware resulting from:

(a) your failure to comply with this Section 13 and/or any applicable Solution-specific Terms; or

(b) normal wear and tear.

13.12 You shall not use any Hardware in the production or processing of illegal crops or substances, or for any other illegal purposes. If you resell the Hardware, you shall also use reasonable efforts to ensure that your customers do not use the Hardware for any illegal purposes.

13.13 In addition to Section 19 (**Indemnity**), you shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless HiTerra from and against all claims, losses, costs and expenses (including legal fees) arising out of:

(a) a Defect in the Hardware due to an act or omission on your part or the part of your representatives;

(b) HiTerra following any specifications supplied by you;

(c) any damage to property, or injury or death of persons arising out of your loading, unloading, transportation, storage, handling, use or disposal of the Hardware; and

(d) in connection with any negligent act or wilful misconduct of or by you our your representatives.
